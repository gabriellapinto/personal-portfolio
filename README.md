# personal-portfolio

## About this Project:
This portfolio was made to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills I learned in the first two weeks of the coding bootcamp. Included in this portfolio, I have various sections of information such as: an About Me section, a Contact Me section, my Works section and a Resume section. I also added media queries and flex-box to make the webpage responsive to all screen sizes. This website will be updated in the future when I learn more skills and languages!
